            <h2><b>20 Minute Complimentary Phone Assessment</b></h2>
            <p>Obtaining a quick idea of what is needed might be all that is required to determine the best direction to take.  We can decide if an onsite walk through would be beneficial.</p>

            <h2><b>$75 / hour  1 hour onsite assessment</b></h2>
            <p>An initial hour onsite assessment is a nice opportunity to get to meet one another, view the problem areas, establish what is priority, determine if supplies are projected to be purchased, discuss space usage and alternative options, as well as to estimate the amount of time required to complete the project.  This will be applied to your first scheduled organizing session, should you decide to plan time.</p>
